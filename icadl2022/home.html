  <p itemprop="description">
    The International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL), which started in Hong Kong in 1998 and, over the years, traveled to many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is known as a significant digital library conference. Along with JCDL and TPDL, ICADL is held annually as one of the three top venues for connecting digital library, computer science, and library and information science communities. 
   </p>
  <p>
    This year ICADL will be held from November 30th to December 2nd, 2022 in Hanoi, Vietnam (Hanoi time zone), as an onsite face-to-face conference but allows those who cannot attend to present their papers online and join sessions. ICADL2022 will be held in conjunction with Asia-Pacific Chapter of iSchools (AP-iSchools). A graduate student symposium will also be held with the Asia-Pacific Chapter of iSchools (AP-iSchools) and A-LIEP communities. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially in semantic search, personalized recommendation, understanding and generation for texts, images, video,  and documents, together with augmented libraries, metaverse, IoT, Blockchain, and Big Data Analytics. With these advances, many innovative applications become possible, and Digital Libraries could play important roles in the research, applications, and practices in this direction. Therefore, the theme for ICADL 2022 is <b>"Augmenting Intelligence in Digital Libraries"</b>. ICADL 2022 will provide an opportunity for researchers from not only Asia-Pacific regions but also all over the world to exchange and discuss their ideas together across different domains to achieve an innovative digital information environment. Attendees are encouraged to join ICADL2022 in-person, or online if physical attendance is difficult. Registration is still required for either way of participation prior to the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Best Paper and the Best Student Paper will be awarded by the Program Committee among the accepted full papers. In addition, same as the last year, selected best papers are planned to be invited for a special issue to be published in the <b><i>International Journal on Digital Libraries</i></b> (IJDL), <b>Springer</b>.

  <p>
  ICADL 2022 will be co-located with AP-iConference 2022, an annual
  conference of Asia Pacific Chapter of iSchools <a href="https://ischools.org" target="_blank">(https://ischools.org)</a>.
  We will have joint keynotes, panels, and a student symposium. We also
  have  the Asia-Pacific Library and Information Education and Practice
  (A-LIEP) community as a joint organizer of the student symposium. We
  believe that this event is an important opportunity to build  a
  stronger international  network  among researchers  in the digital
  library and information science domains.

  <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Proceedings of ICADL 2022 <b>will be published</b> by Springer as an LNCS volume (refer to past series at: <a href="https://link.springer.com/conference/icadl" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/conference/icadl</a>), which is indexed by Scopus. This year, we have the following submission categories: <b>full research papers, short research papers,</b> and <b>practice papers</b> as well as <b>demo/poster papers</b>.</p>
  <p>
    At least 3 Program Committee members will review each submission. The review for practice paper submissions will put less emphasis on the novelty and more on real-world practices and applications of DL technologies in institutions or companies.<br>
    Sufficient time will be given to the oral presentation for accepted papers in all submission categories. Each accepted paper must be presented by at least one of the co-authors. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is any interest in organizing workshops, tutorials, and panel sessions with ICADL 2022, we will consider them on request. Please contact the conference organizers (icadl2022@easychair.org) with your proposal. The information about the accepted events will be put on the conference website, and we will encourage attendees to join the events.
