							<p itemprop="description"><h3><center>The 22nd International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL 2020)</center></h3></p>
							
							<p itemprop="description"><h4><center>Digital Libraries at Times of Massive Societal Transition<br>
							– Collaborating and Connecting Community during Global Change –</center></h4></p>
							
							
							<p itemprop="description">International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL), which started in Hong Kong in 1998 and over the years traveled many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is known as a major digital library conference and is also ranked as “Core A” conference. Along with JCDL and TPDL, ICADL is held annually as one of the three top venues for connecting digital library, computer science and library and information science communities. This year ICADL will be held online from November 30 to December 1, 2020 and according to Japan time zone. ICADL conference will also collaborate with Asia-Pacific Chapter of iSchools (AP-iSchools) in this year.</p>
							
							<p>Many emerging research areas such as Digital Humanities, Open Sciences, Social Informatics originated from digital library research over the past decades, and it is essential that ICADL continues as a platform for scholars to connect and develop in these emerging as well as extant areas. ICADL 2020 is planned as a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and discuss together across domains for innovative digital information environment especially during a time of pandemic, upheavals in work, culture, health services and so on. An important feature of ICADL is the diversity of the Asia-Pacific region in many aspects – languages, cultures, social systems, development levels and technologies. This diversity will bring new ideas and thoughts to the participants.</p>
							
							<p>This year the conference will be <b><u>held online</b></u> same as many other related events due to COVID-19 pandemics. Presentations will be then performed online as well as they will be also recorded and disseminated later for open access by the community. <b>There will be no attendance fee, and only prior registration of the attendees’ information is required. The conference is free for anyone to attend!</b></p>
							
							<p>Proceedings of ICADL 2020 will be published by Springer as an LNCS volume, which is indexed by Scopus. In this year we invite three kinds of submissions: full research papers, short research papers and practitioners papers. Note that there will be no demo or poster submissions for this year. We encourage the potential authors who planned to submit posters or demos to consider extending their submissions to a short paper format that has length up to 6 pages.</p>
